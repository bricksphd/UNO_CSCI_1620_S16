Day 8, Section 5
Abstract classes and Interfaces

The keyword for a class you can't instantiate is 
abstract

public abstract class Car
public abstract class Animal


The real power comes from abstract methods
An abstract method is one that has no implementation in the abstract class
But must be implemented in the subclass.
public abstract void method();


An abstract class can extend an abstract class

A "concrete class" is not abstract
An "abstract class" is abstract


Something that is entirely abstract is...
interface

interface is a keyword that replaces class



Classes extend classes
Classes implement interfaces
Interfaces extend other interfaces

A class can implemented any number of interfaces


So the syntax is:

class A extends B
class A implements C
class A extends B implements C
class A extensd B implements C,D,...
class A implements C,D,...
class A
